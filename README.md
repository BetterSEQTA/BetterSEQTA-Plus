## Getting started

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/SethBurkart123/EvenBetterSEQTA
```

### Windows

Open the `install.bat` file located inside the `scripts` folder. Then after that is finished, open the `dev.bat` file.

### Mac & Linux

1. `cd` into the seqta folder
```
cd EvenBetterSEQTA/scripts
```
2. Make the scripts in the folder executable
```
chmod a+x *
```
3. Run the install and dev scripts
```
sh install.sh
```
4. Open a new terminal session to let the new command activate, then run
```
sh dev.sh
```

### Manual

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Install webpack

```
npm install -g webpack
```

3. Run the dev script (it updates as you save files)

```
npm run dev
```

4. Install and run the dev script for the interface **at the same time** (all custom react components are a separate sub-repository)

```
cd interface

npm install
npm run dev
```


## Folder Structure

The folder structure is as follows:

- The `public` folder contains files that are not compiled, but only copied across to the build directory

- The `src` folder contains source files that are compiled to the build directory, these can use import statements so that we can do code splitting.

- The `interface` folder contains source React files that are required for the UI/UX of the Settings page. It is compiled into the build directory alongside files within `src/`.

- The `build` folder is where the compiled code ends up, this is the folder what you need to load into chrome as an unpacked extension for development.

- The `safari` folder is an Xcode project, building it for MacOS does work, IOS needs a few modifications to the manifest to work, but I have managed to get it working (but because of the styling not being designed for phone, its basically useless for now).
