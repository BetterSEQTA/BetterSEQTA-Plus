## Creating Custom Themes

If you are looking to create custom themes, I would recommend you start at the official documentation [here](https://betterseqta.gitbook.io/betterseqta-docs). You can see some premade examples along with a compilation script that can be used to allow for CSS frameworks and libraries such as SCSS to be used [here](https://github.com/BetterSEQTA/BetterSEQTA-Theme-Generator). 

Don't worry- if you get stuck feel free to ask around in the discord. We're open and happy to help out! Happy creating :)

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/BetterSEQTA/BetterSEQTA-Plus

```
npm install # or your preferred package manager like pnpm or yarn
```

2. Run the dev script (it updates as you save files)

```
npm run dev
```


### Building for production

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install # or your preferred package manager like pnpm or yarn

## Folder Structure

The folder structure is as follows:

- The `src` folder contains source files that are compiled to the build directory.

- The `src/interface` folder contains source React & Svelte files that are required for the Settings page.

- The `dist` folder is where the compiled code ends up, this is the folder what you need to load into chrome as an unpacked extension for development.
