## Getting started

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/SethBurkart123/EvenBetterSEQTA
```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Install webpack

```
npm install -g webpack
```

4. Run the dev script (it updates as you save files)

```
npm run dev
```

5. Install and run the dev script for the interface **at the same time** (all custom react components are a separate sub-repository)

```
cd interface

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Folder Structure

The folder structure is as follows:

- The `public` folder contains files that are not compiled, but only copied across to the build directory

- The `src` folder contains source files that are compiled to the build directory, these can use import statements so that we can do code splitting.

- The `build` folder is where the compiled code ends up, this is the folder what you need to load into chrome as an unpacked extension for development.

- The `safari` folder is an Xcode project, building it for MacOS does work, IOS needs a few modifications to the manifest to work, but I have managed to get it working (but because of the styling not being designed for phone, its basically useless for now).

## Credits

This extension was initially developed by [Nulkem](https://github.com/Nulkem/betterseqta), was ported to manifest V3 by [OG-RandomTechChannel](https://github.com/OG-RandomTechChannel) and is currently under active development by [SethBurkart](https://github.com/SethBurkart123)
