## Creating Custom Themes

If you are looking to create custom themes, I would recommend you start at the official documentation [here](https://betterseqta.gitbook.io/betterseqta-docs). You can see some premade examples along with a compilation script that can be used to allow for CSS frameworks and libraries such as SCSS to be used [here](https://github.com/BetterSEQTA/BetterSEQTA-Theme-Generator).

Don't worry- if you get stuck feel free to ask around in the [discord](https://discord.gg/YzmbnCDkat). We're open and happy to help out! Happy creating :)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build     # Build for all browsers
npm run zip       # Package for distribution (requires 7-Zip)
```

## Folder Structure

The folder structure is as follows:

- The `src` folder contains source files that are compiled to the build directory.

- The `src/plugins` folder contains vital loaders required for BetterSEQTA+ functionality.

- The `src/interface` folder contains source React & Svelte files that are required for the Settings page.

- The `dist` folder is where the compiled code ends up, this is the folder what you need to load into chrome as an unpacked extension for development.
